Howdy. (I live in California which is technically the West 🙃)

- 🔭 I wonder if aliens exist... 🤔
- 📖 I am reading lots of technical books which I never finish.
- 🌱 Keep learning. Keep going. Keep growing.
- 📝 I'm currently extremely busy and have 0 time to code. This will change in the future. I hope.
- 💬 I'd love to chat, but unfortunately I barely have time for anything these days...
- 📫 How to reach me: `HackerDaGreat57@gmail.com` or `hackerdagreat57` on Discord
- 💢 Why are social media companies turning against us? What did we do to them???
- 🦠 Help scientists fight disastrous diseases by [folding@home](https://foldingathome.org/). [Here's my profile](https://stats.foldingathome.org/donor/name/HackerDaGreat57).
- ⚡ Fun (actually pretty sad) fact: I don't get any allowance 😔
- 🎵 [New playlist just dropped](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1O0gNilXGQSgi8t0IsmOg4?si=17dd8b1d705b42fe) (I was not paid to put this here, and yes, this playlist symbolizes "middle school crush shenanigans" pretty nicely)

I know a *bit* of Batchfile, Shell script, Python, and Java. Although I am somewhat familiar with C/C++, I'm not (yet) what you'd call a developer who knows *exactly* what he's doing. LOL
