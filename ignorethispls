#install.sh: installation script for ultragcc
#ultragcc is a version of GCC compiled with specific arguments to run as fast as possible on any GCC-supported CPU. It enforces use of all sorts of weird tricks to make code run faster. This script guides you through the process, or you can automate with command-line arguments.
